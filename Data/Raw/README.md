# Overview
The /Raw folder is a critical starting point in the football player data analysis pipeline. This folder contains the original, unprocessed data as it was initially collected or received. The data in this state is unaltered and includes all the raw details without any cleaning, filtering, or transformation. It serves as the most authentic source of information and is used as the baseline for all subsequent data processing and analysis.

# Expected Data Structure
The files within this folder are typically stored in a variety of formats, depending on the source of the data. Common formats include XLSX, CSV, and sometimes JSON or XML files. These formats are chosen based on the nature of the data sources and the requirements of the data collection process.

# Expected Files
Files in the /Raw folder can vary widely but generally include:
- player_performance_data: Files containing raw statistical data on player performances in matches, training sessions, or other relevant settings.

# File Contents
The contents of these files are diverse and can include a wide range of data points, such as:
- Player performance metrics like goals, assists, pass completion rates, tackles, etc.

# Usage
The raw data files are used as the input for the data cleaning and pre-processing stages. They are the foundation upon which all data transformations and analyses are built. Analysts and data scientists working with these files need to perform various tasks such as data cleansing, dealing with missing values, standardizing formats, and extracting relevant features to prepare the data for more advanced processing steps.
