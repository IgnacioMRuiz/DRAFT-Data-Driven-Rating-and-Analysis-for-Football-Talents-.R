# Overview
The /Segmented folder plays a crucial role in the football player data analysis pipeline, marking the stage where data is divided based on player positions. This folder emerges as a result of segmenting player data from a unified dataset into distinct groups, each representing a specific position on the field. This segmentation aligns with the diverse roles and responsibilities inherent to different player positions, setting the stage for more targeted and position-specific analyses.

# Expected Data Structure
The files within this folder are organized in XLSX format.

# Expected Files
Each file in the /Segmented folder corresponds to a unique player position, encompassing data that has been specifically filtered and segmented from a larger, comprehensive dataset of player statistics.

# File Naming Convention
Files in this folder follow the naming convention: [Position]_stats.xlsx, where [Position] is replaced with the specific player position such as Forward, Midfielder, Defender, etc. This convention aids in the straightforward identification and access of data relevant to specific player roles.

# File Contents
Each segmented file contains columns representing a range of player performance metrics pertinent to the respective position. These metrics might include, but are not limited to, aspects such as goals scored, assists, defensive actions, passes completed, and more, depending on the nature of the position.

# Usage
The segmented data files are a preparatory step for more advanced processing, such as normalization and clustering. Analysts and data scientists can utilize these files to conduct detailed analyses tailored to each player position, enabling a more nuanced understanding of player performances and roles. This segmentation is especially beneficial for comparative studies across different player positions or for investigating position-specific patterns and trends in player data.
